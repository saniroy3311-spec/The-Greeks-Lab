/**
 * Volume: a per-bar histogram colored by candle direction.
 *
 * Emitted as two histogram series so the engine can paint each bar in a single
 * color without per-bar color support:
 *   - "up"   holds the volume on bars where close >= open (else null), green.
 *   - "down" holds the volume on bars where close <  open (else null), red.
 * Exactly one of the two is non-null per bar, so they never overlap.
 *
 * Integrator note: this sub-pane should fit [0, maxVolume] (bars grow up from a
 * zero baseline). We deliberately do NOT declare a fixed `range` here, because
 * the max volume is data-dependent and the engine's pane auto-fit already
 * anchors histogram baselines at 0 (computePaneScale: `if (min > 0) min = 0`).
 * Since volume is always >= 0, that yields exactly [0, maxVolume]. If that
 * zero-anchoring is ever removed and the fit centers on min..max instead, the
 * bars will be offset/clipped — re-anchor the floor at 0.
